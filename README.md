# MyTick frontend project

Laris Store is a modern e-commerce platform designed to simplify the buying and selling of electronic products such as smartphones, computers, TVs, and other electronic devices. This project is built with a frontend powered by ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, and a robust backend using Golang and PostgreSQL.

Laris Store allows users to browse a variety of electronic products, add items to their cart, proceed to checkout, and complete secure payments with ease. All these processes are supported by a stable and efficient backend system, ensuring a smooth and reliable shopping experience.
